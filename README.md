My name's Zach, I'm a youtuber, and I like languages.

(this is PIE, an old language in Europe)

*side note, there's no word for "oldest" lol, but essentially, PIE is the common ancestor of Indo-European languages, dating back to around 4500-2000 BC*



I also am a conlanger! ***Otekar! Asōv ardonsāsot oca!*** (Hi! Nice to see you!) *((eugh I hate this lang family))*

I am still working on figuring stuff out though.



I also code sometimes, I guess that's obvious too. I have my most experience in Python and x86 NASM, with C# in second place, the rest are pretty much uncharted territory for me.

Also I'm a silly catboy sometimes ig :3
